ITA is the top-1 engineering school in Brazil with a selective admission process with an acceptance rate of 2%. There, I was involved in research projects in the field of aerospace engineering and aerodynamics theory for airplanes and rocketships being awarded a national scholarship from the <a\n  href=\"https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br\"\n  rel=\"nofollow\"\n>CNPq</a> for studying wavy leading edge phenomena with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Also, I ran experiments in the wind tunnel of the ITA for the development of a sounding rocket for <a\n  href\n>XXth the America’s rocket competion XXX</a>.\nIn 2018, I was awarded an excellence scholarship to pursue my master’s degree at <a\n  href=\"https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/\"\n  rel=\"nofollow\"\n>ISAE-SUPAERO</a> in Toulouse, France. There, I was selected for the Data Science and Applied Mathematics major. During my master’s, I was involved in a research project at the intersection of machine learning and communication systems leading to my first journal publication. I also did free-lance work for <a\n  href=\"https://www.liebherr.com/en/int/products/components/engineering/engineering.html\"\n  rel=\"nofollow\"\n>Liebherr Engineering</a> in the field of data science.</p>\n<p>As a fun side project, I co-developed <a\n  href=\"https://promptriddle.com\"\n  rel=\"nofollow\"\n>promptriddle</a>, a challenging enigma solving game on an emulated terminal with over 2000 players.</p>\n"}
