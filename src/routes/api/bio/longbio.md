I am a PhD Candidate in Machine Learning at [CentraleSupélec]()-[Université Paris-Saclay]() interested in safe and robust AI.
I am supervised by Prof. [Pablo Piantanida]() and Prof. [Florence Alberge]().
My PhD is supported by the BPI France through the IBM's Research project [AIDA: Artificial Intelligence for Digital Automation](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/news/artificial-intelligence-digital-automation-aida-promising-joint-public-private-project-ai). Through my work, I hope to contribute to the greater good of society by developing responsible and safe algorithms.

In 2023, I was selected to participate in [the Nordic Probabilistic AI School (ProbAI)]() in Trondheim, Norway.
In 2022, I was awarded the [MITACS Globalink scholarship]() for a four-month internship at [MILA]() and [ETS]() in Montreal, QC, Canada.
In 2021, I got my [first first-author paper]() accepted at a top AI conference ([ICLR2022]()).

Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the [Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA)]() in Brazil and my master's degree from [ISAE-SUPAERO]() in France. ITA is the top-1 engineering school in Brazil with a selective admission process with an acceptance rate of 2%. There, I was involved in research projects in the field of aerospace engineering and aerodynamics theory for airplanes and rocketships being awarded a national scholarship from the [CNPQ]() for studying wavy leading edge phenomena with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Also, I ran experiments in the wind tunnel of the ITA for the development of a sounding rocket for [XXth the America's rocket competion XXX]().
In 2018, I was awarded an excellence scholarship to pursue my master's degree at ISAE-SUPAERO. There, I was selected for the Data Science and Applied Mathematics major. During my master's, I was involved in a research project at the intersection of machine learning and communication systems leading to my [first journal]() publication. I also did free-lance work for [Liebherr]() in the field of data science and I developed an [enigma solving game](https://promptriddle.com) with friends.
