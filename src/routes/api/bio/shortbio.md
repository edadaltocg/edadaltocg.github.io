I am a PhD Candidate in Machine Learning at [CentraleSupélec]()-[Université Paris-Saclay]() interested in safe and robust AI.
I am supervised by Prof. [Pablo Piantanida]() and Prof. [Florence Alberge]().
My PhD is supported by the BPI France through the IBM's Research project [AIDA: Artificial Intelligence for Digital Automation](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/news/artificial-intelligence-digital-automation-aida-promising-joint-public-private-project-ai). Through my work, I hope to contribute to the greater good of society by developing responsible and safe algorithms.
