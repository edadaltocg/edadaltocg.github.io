I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning at CentraleSupélec-Université Paris-Saclay, where I work under the guidance of Prof. Pablo Piantanida. My research is focused on developing safer deep learning algorithms, with a particular emphasis on out-of-distribution detection, robustness, and uncertainty detection. Through my work, I hope to contribute towards a future where AI is leveraged for the greater good of society.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA). Following that, I moved to France after being awarded an excellence scholarship to pursue a master's degree in Data Science and Applied Mathematics from ISAE-SUPAERO
